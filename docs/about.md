## About me
Iâ€™m 3KY, an Ethical Hacker with a passion for Red Team operations and cybersecurity. This space is dedicated to the cybersecurity community, providing resources and materials to enhance your knowledge and skills in the field.

I enjoy solving machines on Hack The Box (HTB) and lead my team, PWNNET, which has reached the TOP #40 Global in the S5. We're committed to continuing to solve machines to learn and stay updated with current vulnerabilities. In Chile, Iâ€™m ranked in the TOP 5. Besides cybersecurity, I love playing Age of Empires II, Quake 3, and Diablo 2, and Iâ€™m also into Ph-fishing. ðŸŽ£

## About docs
In this Digital Garen, you'll find write-ups, CTF solutions, translations, and proof of concepts. Each entry is crafted to either share my findings or help you solve challenges through detailed explanations. My goal is to have all my notes neatly organized and accessible, while also offering valuable content for learning and entertainment. I hope you find this space both useful and enriching.

## About shop
I've opened an online store specifically designed for cybersecurity enthusiasts. In it, you'll find products carefully selected for the hacking community, including the Flipper Zero and its accessories, along with other resources to strengthen your skills in Red Team operations. Currently, I accept payments through PayPal and bank transfer.
